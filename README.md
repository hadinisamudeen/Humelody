# Humelody
**An audio application that transcribe your simple 'hums' into a musical instrument!**

The aim of this project is to aid new and upcoming musicians who have little knowledge in music theory, in music production, with the help of a studio plugin.

“Humelody” is an Audio Application that helps music producers who have just a beginner’s knowledge of music theory and instruments to ace past all and make melodies using just their voice in creating and producing music with a few simple clicks of buttons, rather than spending much time learning about theories in music, the ‘rules and regulations’ and so on. 
                      The  main role/function of the Audio app is to grasp in the user’s ‘*monophonic*’(only one melody) vocals (like a ‘hum’), as a sample (an audio input), detect the right notes played throughout the input,  **_converts into a melody of the same notes played on a musical instrument_** (i.e, transcription) as an output that can be used for any other available Audio. 
          Other features include:
* Converting the input monophonic sample into a MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) file;
*	A ‘hum only’ mode where the audio input can be recorded and used as a melody by itself.


As a music lover and a coding enthusiast, I plan on making this project available to TUD and continue working on it so I could hopefully give the potential music producers a helping hand by providing something they need, that wasn’t thought about.
 
######COMMIT UPDATE 20/10/2020 
Now you can view the code files through the "Code Files" folder, consisting of the YIN algorithm (implemented on C++, taliored for Humelody), a Default oscillator, and the code to the working of the project (note detection, setting timestamps, convertion to MIDI files, etc)
